A minimalist physics-based game inspired by Flappy Bird, where you control a bouncing ball to navigate through dynamically generated pipes. This game is made entirely using Python and Pygame!

---

### **Features** ✨
- Simple and intuitive controls
- Procedurally generated pipes with random gaps
- Responsive physics-based gameplay
- High score tracking between sessions
- Start/Restart screen and Game Over interface
- 400x600 resolution window for consistent experience
- Start screen, gameplay loop, and game over menu with restart option

---

### **Controls** 🕹️

### **How to Play** 🎮
1. Press **SPACE** to start the game
2. Press **SPACE** to make the ball jump
3. Time your jumps carefully to pass through pipe gaps
